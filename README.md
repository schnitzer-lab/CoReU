This full processing pipeline is described in **upcoming biorxiv link** [Haziza et al., 2024](https://www.biorxiv.org/). The convolutional unmixing procedure was first introduced in a talk [Kruzhilin et al., 2023](https://www.sfn.org/-/media/SfN/Documents/NEW-SfN/Meetings/Neuroscience-2023/Abstracts/Abstract-PDFs/SFN23_Abstracts-PDF-Nano.pdf).
